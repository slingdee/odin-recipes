    <h2>Procedure</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
          Start by making the sauce with ground beef, bell peppers, onions, and a combo of tomato sauce, tomato paste, and crushed tomatoes. The three kinds of tomatoes gives the sauce great depth of flavor.

      <li>
          Let this simmer while you boil the noodles and get the cheeses ready. We're using ricotta, shredded mozzarella, and parmesanâ€”like the mix of tomatoes, this 3-cheese blend gives the lasagna great flavor!
      </li>
      <li>
          From there, it's just an assembly job. A cup of meat sauce, a  layer of noodles, more sauce, followed by a layer of cheese. Repeat until you have three layers and have used up all the   ingredients.
      </li>
      <li>Bake until bubbly and you're ready to eat!</li>
    </ol>
