      Ndizi mbichi (matoke) na nyama ya ng'ombe or matoke with beef is a Kenyan dish (and most of the African continent). This dish also has vegetables like hoho (bell peppers), green garden peas and carrots. It's also spicy with a tropical flavour courtesy of the coconut cream.

  <ul class="custom-ul">
    <li>12 Matoke</li>
    <li>1 kg Beef on bone</li>
    <li>1 Large red onion</li>
    <li>2 Large tomatoes</li>
    <li>1 Tbs ginger garlic paste</li>
    <li>1 Medium sized green hoho</li>
    <li>1 Tbsp Curry powder</li>
    <li>1 tsp Turmeric powder </li>
    <li>12 Matoke</li>
    <li>1 cup Green garden peas</li>
  </ul>
    <h2>Procedure</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
          Add the finely diced red onions and the curry powder - mix well. Cook until the onions start turning brown at the edges.
      </li>
      <li>
         Add the ginger garlic paste then cook it for about a minute until fragrant.
      </li>
      <li>
        Next, add the tomatoes, turmeric powder, chilli beef bullion, the dry bay leaf, freshly cracked black pepper and the pre-boiled beef. 
      </li>
      <li>Then, add enough beef stock to just cover the top of the beef, stir everything together, cover sufuria and leave to simmer for about ten minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the matoke with just enough of the beef stock to ensure that the matoke cooks without completely being submerged. Simmer for about five minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the carrots and coconut cream at once then cover and leave to simmer for about five minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the coloured hohos along with the blanched green garden peas, mix everything in. Use an extremely gentle touch. Simmer for about three minutes until the hohos just start softening.
      </li>
      <li>
        Finally add the dhania leaves and turn off the heat
